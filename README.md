"# check_the_frequency" 


The project is all about visualize word frequency.It will show you how many times a word occurs in a sample text or plain text in a graph and its comparison with Ziph's law.So,Zipf's law was originally formulated in terms of quantitative linguistics, stating that given some corpus of natural language utterances, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. Thus the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third most frequent word, etc.: the rank-frequency distribution is an inverse relation.You can chek more about the law here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law
